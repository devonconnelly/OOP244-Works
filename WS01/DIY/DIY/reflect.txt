In this workshop I had trouble figuring out how to display the GPA value to the proper amount of decimal places as when the GPA was 4.0, only 4 would print to the console. To solve this I had to look through the api to find the setprecision function where you set the amount of decimal places to display when printing to the console. I also had some trouble figuring out how to scan the csv file. To solve this I had to refer back to my final assignment from ipc144 where we worked with file data transferring to find how to use fscanf to properly save data from a csv file to variables. Also for sorting the data in the csv file in ascending order by student number I used a bubble sort which I remember doing in my ipc144 in my assignment.
